project-euler
=============

These are my implementations for some of the problems listed on Project Euler. (http://www.projecteuler.net) Some of the problems were extremely easy and did not even need me to write a script outside of a python terminal. The code in these folders were for problems that required scripts a little bit longer. Some of them are formally written with functions, while simpler ones are written straight as a script. All work done in Python.

Note: some of these scripts are for problems I have not yet completed! There are a few problems that I have attempted but my solution requires too much computation. Usually a comment will be written in the code to indicate this :)
